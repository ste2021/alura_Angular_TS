## [Angular]('https://angular.io/docs') - First Steps 

#### [*] First you need to have Node JS <img src="https://github.com/ste2021/images-icons/blob/master/icons8-nodejs.svg" width=24 height=25 />installed, start by running the following command in the terminal:

``npm install -g @ angular / cli``

If you want a specific version, put it at the end of the cli, otherwise the last version will be installed automatically.

### Run the new CLI ng command and provide the name for you app / ps: you can choose any name:
```ng new my-app```

#### Run the application

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.
Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.

## Run the following command:
 ``cd my-app ``
``ng serve --open``
