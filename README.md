``npm install -g @ angular / cli``

If you want a specific version, put it at the end of the cli, otherwise the last version will be installed automatically.

### Run the new CLI ng command and provide the name for you app / ps: you can choose any name:
```ng new my-app```

#### Run the application

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.
Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.

## Run the following command:
 ``cd my-app ``
``ng serve --open``
